~~I changed my workspace to the direct upper level (in order to have dendron.yml file and all in the VSCode sidebar). It appears to work however now i dont have more completion of my snippets (//TODO, time etc.)
Is it linked ? ~~ Yes, as I understand it now, the snippets should be in the dendron.cod-snippets.json file in the .vscode folder of the current workspace.
