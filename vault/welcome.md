## What's after wilderness  🏔️ 🦖

This note initially came after the dendron introduction [[dendron]] ... but let's put it as a welcome word !

### What is this ?

You might find  a lot of stuff on this personal dendron website. It has for objective to be used as a dump for ideas, todo lists, read lists, ... [fill the dots] or an electronic lab notebook. You can see it as a digital experiment aiming to gather :

- [ ] Academic research material of exploratory projects around natural products, biodiversity & ecology - an [anti-marketing application](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS)

It is also: 

- [ ] A garage, lab and workshop with [open doors](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). See first notes here [[garage]]

### Why ?

It is a first attempt to commit to :

- [ ] A public [[pledge]] (inspired by Daniel Mietchen).

### And then what ?

Help me to grow this dendron, let's add sections and branches together !
