# Working with the garage door opened

A way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. If we apply this "working with the garage door open" idea to a scientific research endeavor I understand it as respecting the core concepts of open-science.

What is interesting is that in a garage you can peek in and get a sense of the tools, the dirt and a bunch of unrelated stuff and the object crafted in the workshop (furnitures, cars, computers, bombs, strange chemicals). You can see these objects in their final form but most of the time you will see them in their unfinished forms. The fact that people passing by are able to peek at the garage in the very early stages of the projects are of much interest and maybe still not very much adopted in science. I would like to experiment on this concept also. This second note of Andy explains this Anti-marketing concept nicely as https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS


TODO make a list of similar types of research strategies in academic or personal research
