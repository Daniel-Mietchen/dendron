# Bib integration tests in dendron

The .bib is loaded if the path to th .bib is in the header (check in the .md file)


active citation @Gerwick2012a

hardcoded copy pasted citation Gerwick and Moore (2012)


Gerwick, William H, and Bradley S Moore. 2012. “Lessons from the past and charting the future of marine natural products drug discovery and chemical biology.” Chemistry & Biology 19 (1): 85–98. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2011.12.014.


The citation can be previewed only if Markdown Preview Enhanced is loaded. However the links can then not be viewed by Dendron Markdown Preview. Kevin is working on it https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/794977929406185502

Meanwhile a solution is to copy paste the citation from the preview to the .md.

I now hae to check if links are displayed and active when published.
Locally, hey are active in the .md
